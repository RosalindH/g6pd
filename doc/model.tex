The gene frequencies of HbS and other alleles will be written as $s$ and $a$ throughout. Similarly, the sickle-cell disease, sickle-cell trait and non-sickle-cell genotype frequencies will be written as $SS$, $SA$ and $AA$.

What are all the possible relationships between the genotype frequencies and the gene frequencies? Write $SS=s^2+m$. To preserve the frequency $s=SS+AS/2$, using $s-s^2=sa$, you know that $AS=2as-2m$. Then, to preserve the frequency $AA$, you need $AA=a^2+m$. So there is one `degree of freedom'.

The parameterizations chosen most often are:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\begin{array}{c}AA=a^2(1-f)+af\\AS=2as(1-f)\\SS=s^2(1-f)+sf\end{array} &\textup{and}&
\begin{array}{c}AA=a^2+m\\AS=2as-2m\\SS=s^2+m\end{array}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Any population's genotype frequencies can be parameterized this way; this mathematical fact is not dependent on population dynamics, mating behavior, selection or anything else. However, the usual interpretation of $f$ as a measure of inbreeding \emph{does} require additional assumptions. 

For example, say the frequencies $a$ and $s$ have stabilized under selection in a population. Say that a sample of individuals of reproductive age is taken, which does not find any $SS$ individuals due to high childhood mortality. Assume further that the population mates randomly, so that in newborns the Hardy-Weinberg frequencies apply:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    AA_0 = a^2\\
    AS_0 = 2as\\
    SS_0 = s^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
The adult sample will be in proportions 
\begin{eqnarray*}
    AA:&\frac{a^2}{a^2+2kas}\\
    AS:&\frac{2kas}{a^2+2kas}\\
    SS:&0
\end{eqnarray*}
where the selection coefficient $k$ can be determined from $s$ and the fact that gene frequencies in newborns have to match gene frequencies in reproductive individuals. That means $f$ for the sample population is equal to $s/(1-s)$ even though there is no inbreeding.

\bigskip
$f$ and $m$ have a probabilistic interpretation. The probability of finding $a$ on the second chromosome in an individual given that $a$ was found on the first is equal to $a(1-f)+f$, or equivalently $a+m/a$. If $m$ is zero, or equivalently $f$ is zero, then the event that $a$ is found on the second chromosome is independent of the event that it is found on the first and you get the Hardy-Weinberg proportions:
\begin{eqnarray*}
    AA=a^2\\
    AS=2as\\
    SS=s^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
